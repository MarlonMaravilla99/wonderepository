                        <p class="bodytxt" >The Nike Air Jordan III Retro White/Cement from 2011 was a long overdue release. By 2011, the White Cement Jordan III had sat in the vault at Nike since the 2003 release. Which meant, for most sneakerheads, you had already burned through at least a pair or two of the iconic Jordan 3 sneaker. This variation of the White Cement Jordan III Retro was the first time it became a problem that the "Nike Air" wasn’t on the heel of the shoe. 
                             Purists might have been offish with the 2003 release but soon enough it became mainstream to complain about the Jumpman stamp on the heel thanks Social Media.
                             <br> Outside of sneaker enthusiasts, however, it didn’t matter because the memories of the 1988 Dunk Contest, and MJ taking off from the free throw line still conjured up memories for Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan fans. In terms of quality and availability, the 2011 Air Jordan Retro 3 White Cement might be the lowest of all the original colorways but it will always have a mass appeal that most sneakers will never have thanks to Michael Jordan.

                            <p class="bodytxt">They were the first pair of Jordan sneakers that legendary designer Tinker Hatfield created, and they made their official debut in the year 1988. In terms of its design, they served as the first Air Jordan model to utilize visible Air units, Jumpman logos, as well as the recognizable elephant print. The original sketches of these kicks featured a Swoosh logo placed on the midfoot, and those were brought to life through multiple renditions for the silhouette’s 30th anniversary year in 2018. <br>
                                The Air Jordan 3 is expected to make a number of appearances throughout 2022, the most exciting of which will release in the Summer and Fall. So far, reputable sources have confirmed the return of the “Fire Red” and "Red Cardinal" colorways as well as new make-ups like the “Dark Iris” and “Desert.”</p>
